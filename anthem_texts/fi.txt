O our home country, Finland, the land where we were born,
sound high, you golden word!
There is no valley, no mountain,
no lake or shore more dear,
than this northern home,
the land of our fathers.

There shall be time
when you will burst
into full blossom,
then our love shall be roused
by your glorious hope and joy,
at last, your song, o motherland,
will sound in higher tone!
