# Multimodal Data Collection and Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on collecting and analyzing datasets across multiple modalitiesâ€”images, text, audio, and structured data. We explore relationships between these different data types using various machine learning and statistical techniques.

---
## **1. Data Collection**
### **A. Image Dataset Collection**
- Selected **20 different categories**.
- Sourced images from **Google Images** and other image repositories.
- Stored and organized images for analysis.

Here are some sample images from our dataset

### **B. Text Dataset Collection**
- Chose **20 different categories** and identified **three websites per category**.
- Implemented a **web crawler** to extract relevant text data (e.g., article titles, content, publication date).
- Stored the collected data in a structured format.

### **C. Audio Dataset Collection**
- Identified **publicly available AM/FM radio stations** that stream audio online.
- Developed an **automated script** to record and store **30-90 second** audio samples.
- Saved **30 audio files** in **WAV/MP3 format** and recorded metadata (station name, timestamp, duration).

### **D. Weather Dataset Collection**
- Utilized an **open-source weather API** (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) to collect **historical and real-time weather data**.
- Implemented **periodic data collection** over a month to observe trends.

### **E. Government Open Data Analysis**
- Selected a dataset from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in).
- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing**.
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends, correlations, and insights.

## **2. Flag and National Anthem Dataset**
### **A. Data Collection**
- **Flags:** Collected images of national flags from at least **100 nations**.
- **Anthems:** Obtained English translations of national anthems from [National Anthems Info](https://nationalanthems.info/).
- **Audio:** Collected **music compositions (MP3 files)** of national anthems for a subset of countries.

### **B. Visual Analysis**
- Analyzed **flag images** using data analysis techniques.
- Validated insights from a **blog post on flag analysis**.
- Discovered new patterns in flag designs, colors, and symbols.

### **C. Textual Analysis**
- Preprocessed **anthem translations** (stopword removal, tokenization, lemmatization).
- Conducted linguistic analysis to extract **patterns and themes**.

### **D. Audio Analysis**
- Processed **national anthem audio files** (spectral analysis, tempo detection, MFCC features).
- Identified unique **rhythmic and tonal patterns**.

### **E. Multimodal Correlation Analysis**
- Explored **relationships between flag design, anthem lyrics, and anthem music**.
- Applied **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)** and **Kernel CCA** to analyze cross-modal relationships.
- Used **Machine Learning** and **statistical techniques** to discover patterns linking images, text, and audio.
- Implemented **Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KernelPCA)** for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

## **3. Technologies & Tools Used**
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, Scikit-learn, Librosa)
- **Web Scraping** (Requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- **Machine Learning** (Canonical Correlation Analysis, Kernel CCA, Kernel PCA, TF-IDF, MFCC analysis)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **APIs** (OpenWeatherMap, Government Open Data APIs)

---
## **4. Results & Insights**
- Identified **color distributions and symbolic patterns** in national flags.
- Extracted **linguistic themes** and **sentiment** from national anthems.
- Discovered correlations between **anthem music compositions and national identity**.
- Explored **multimodal relationships** between flags, anthems, and audio features.

---
## **5. Future Scope**
- Expand dataset collection to **more countries and categories**.
- Apply **Deep Learning techniques** for improved multimodal analysis.
- Investigate **historical and geopolitical factors** influencing flag design and anthem composition.
- Develop an interactive **visualization dashboard** to present insights dynamically.
